# C Playground 

I plan on using this repository to store my C code. I will be using this to learn C and to store my code for future reference.
I wanted to use a git repo instead of just my local machine not only to save my things to the cloud but also to be able to track my progress and to be able to see how I have improved over time.

I'd like to be able to create my tip tracking application in C if it isn't going to be too insane for me. My final project should be something akin to:

A GUI that opens up and has a series of cards/panels/etc. that have the information of people I've delivered to. The information should be short and simple, such as just the address and whether or not they tipped. I can make it optional to add their name, phone number, and the amount that they tipped. I want there to be a button to create a new card and input the previous information. I want to be able to delete and edit cards accordingly. Sorting would also be a nice feature. At the top or somewhere off to the side, I want a search box that will have you type in an address and show all the resulting cards that include that address. 

A very advanced feature that I would like to eventually implement would be to have a notification pop up if it's a duplicate entry; This would be very complicated, however, because I know that people will order from the same location multiple times, and I'd like a way to show how many times I've delivered to that specific address and put how much they've tipped each time I've delivered. This is in the very distant future, however, as I am a complete 100% beginner to C as of typing this (4/21/2023).
